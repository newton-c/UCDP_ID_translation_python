# UCDP ID translations

This is an attempt at making the translation from new to old, or old to new,
UCDP actor, conflict, and dyad IDs, a single line in python.

`ucdp_ids.py` has the main functions. Use `testing_script.py` for testing. The
main function is `ucdp_ids(id_var, source_id, target_id, code_type)`
