# UCDP ID translations

This is an attempt at making the translation from new to old, or old to new,
UCDP actor, conflict, and dyad IDs, a single line in python.

## Usage:
`ucdp_ids.py` has the main functions. Use `testing_script.py` for testing. The
main function is `ucdp_ids(id_var, source_id, target_id, code_type)`. `id_var`
is the variable containing the ID to be translated. `source_id` indicates
whether the `id_var` contains an old or new id, while `target_id` indicates
whether you want to translate to a new or old id. Both take the arguments
`'new_id'` or `'old_id'`. Finally, `code_type` identifies which ID is being
translated. The current options are `'actor_id'`, `'conflict_id'`, or
`'dyad_id'`.

## Example:
`old_ids = ucdp_ids(df['acd_conflict_id'], 'new_id', 'old_id', 'conflict_id')`

This takes the variable `'acd_conflict_id'` from the dataframe `df`, which is
the new UCDP conflict ID (as indicated by `'new_id'` and `conflict_id`),
and translates to the old UCDP conflict ID (due to the input `old_id`). The
old id is saved as a new vector `old_ids`.

## R:
A similar package is being developed for python. You can see it in its current
state here: [UCDP_ID_translation_R](https://github.com/newton-c/UCDP_ID_translation_R)
